<h1>Structure of HTML</h1>
<h4></h4>
   <p><b>HTML documents are built with the following components:</b></p>
   <ol type="1">
    <li><b>HTML Tags:</b> These are the building blocks of HTML. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets < > and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content is placed between the opening and closing tags.</li>
   <br>
   <p>Example:</p>
   <img src="Screenshot_2.png" alt="">
   <br>
   <li><b>Attributes:</b> Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about an element. Attributes are always specified in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs like </li>
   <code>name="value".</code>
   <br>
   <p>Example:</p>
   <img src="Screenshot_1.png" alt="">
   <li><b>Elements:</b> Elements are made up of tags and their content, including text and other nested elements. Some common HTML elements include headings (< h1 > to < h6 >), paragraphs (< p >), links (< a >), images (< img >), lists (< ul >, < ol >, < li >), forms (< form >, < input >, < button> ), and more.</li>
</ol>

<h1>How HTML Works</h1>
<p><b>When a web browser loads an HTML document, it reads the HTML tags to understand the structure of the content. It then renders the content according to the instructions provided by those tags. For example, an < h1 > tag indicates a main heading, while a < p > tag signifies a paragraph.</b></p>
<hr>
<h1>Semantic HTML</h1>
<p><b>Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML tags that convey meaning beyond just presentation. This helps search engines, screen readers, and other devices understand the content better. Examples include < header >, < nav >, < article >, < section >, < footer >, etc.</b></p>
<hr>
<h1>HTML 5</h1>
<p><b>HTML has evolved over time, with HTML5 being the latest version. HTML5 introduces new elements and attributes that make it easier to create modern and dynamic web pages. It supports multimedia, graphics, and interactive content without needing plugins like Flash.</b></p>
<h1>Learning HTML</h1>
<P><b>Learning HTML is often the first step for anyone interested in web development. It is relatively easy to learn and allows you to create static websites quickly. Many online resources, tutorials, and courses are available for beginners to get started with HTML.</b></P>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p><b>In essence, HTML is the fundamental language of the web. It provides the structure and content of web pages, allowing developers to create everything from simple static pages to complex interactive sites. Understanding HTML is crucial for anyone aspiring to become a web developer or looking to create their presence on the internet.</b></p>
