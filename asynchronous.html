                <h2>What is Synchronous Code?</h2>
                    <p>
                        When we write a program in JavaScript, it executes line by line. When
                        a line is completely executed, then and then only does the code move 
                        forward to execute the next line.Let's look at an example of this:
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                let greet_one = "Hello" <br>
                                let greet_two = "World!!!" <br> 
                                console.log(greet_one) <br>
                                for(let i=0;i<1000000000;i++){ <br>                                
                                }                           <br>
                                console.log(greet_two); <br>
                            </code>
                        </pre>

                        Now if you run the above example on your machine you will notice 
                        that greet_one logs first. Then the program waits for a couple of
                        seconds and then logs greet_two. This is because the code executes
                        line by line. This is called synchronous code. This creates lot of 
                        problems. For example, if a certain piece of code takes 10 seconds 
                        to execute, the code after it won't be able to execute until it's 
                        finished, causing delays.

                    <h2>What is Asynchronous Code?</h2>
                    <p>
                        With asynchronous code, multiple tasks can execute at the same time 
                        while tasks in the background finish. This is what we call 
                        non-blocking code. The execution of other code won't stop while 
                        an asynchronous task finishes its work.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Let's see an example of asynchronous code:

                        <pre>
                            <code>
                            let greet_one = "Hello" <br>
                            let greet_two = "World!!!" <br>
                            console.log(greet_one)  <br>
                            setTimeout(function(){  <br>
                            console.log("Asynchronous");   <br>
                            }, 10000)   <br>
                            console.log(greet_two);   <br>
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                </p>
                </article>
                <img src="./assets/images/async.png" alt="Asynchronous JavaScript" id="async">
                <article>
                    <p>
                        In the above example, if you run the code on your machine you will 
                        see greet_one and greet_two logged even there is code in between 
                        those 2 logs.
                        <br><br>
                        Now, setTimeout is asynchronous so it runs in background, allowing 
                        code after it to execute while it runs. After 10 seconds, 
                        Asynchronous will print because we set a time of 10 seconds in 
                        setTimeout to execute it after 10 seconds.
                        <br><br>
                        In this tutorial, we will study asynchronous JavaScript in detail 
                        so you can learn how to write your own asynchronous code. 
                        I just wanted to give you a taste of async JavaScript using in-built
                        functions to whet your appetite.

                    <h2>How Promises Work in JavaScript</h2>  
                    <p>
                        A promise is placeholder for the future result of an 
                        asynchronous operation. In simple words, we can say it is a 
                        container for a future value. <br>
                        When using promises, we don't need to relay on callbacks which 
                        helps us avoid callback hell. <br>
                        Before showing you how promises work through code, I'll explain 
                        promises using the analogy of a lottery ticket. <br>
                        Promises are like lottery ticket. When we buy a lottery ticket, 
                        it says we will get money if our outcome is right. This is like a 
                        promise. The lottery draw happens asynchronously, and if the 
                        numbers match, we receive the money which was promised.
                        <br><br>
                        Now let's look at a code example:
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                const request = fetch('https://course-api.com/react-store-products')
                                console.log(request);
                            </code>
                        </pre>
